The expression constructs are transiently transfected into HEK293 cells according to the FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (ROCHE) instructions. Within twenty-four hours, transiently transfected cells are harvested and either seeded directly into assay plate or cryopreserved for future usage.Transfected cells may be either cryopreserved or freshly transfected and plated into clearbase poly-D-lysine coated 384-well plates (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA) at a density of 10,000 cells per well in culture medium and grown overnight. The following day, all medium is removed and the cells are incubated with 52 uL of 0.5x Calcium 3 Dye (Molecular Devices) prepared in complete assay buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, and 2.5 mM probenecid at 37Â° C. for thirty five minutes. The cells are then incubated for an additional fifteen minutes at room temperature before initiating experiments. Following incubation, plates are inserted into a FDSS instrument, where cells were challenged with compounds of the formula (I) (at varying concentrations) and intracellular Ca2+ are measured for 5 min prior to the addition of icilin at the EC80concentration IC50 values for compounds of the formula (I) are determined from eight point dose-response studies.";"B";"BAO_0000219";"cell-based format";"None";"None";"None";"HEK293";"None";"";"";"";"CHEMBL1075319";"Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8";"Homo sapiens";"SINGLE PROTEIN";"CHEMBL3886941";"37";"BindingDB Database";"";"2016";"CHEMBL3307715";"";"";""
